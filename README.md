# MyGithubLists

This is a .Net MVC 5.0 Program to pull the most starred repositories from Github, using official Github API and Octokit.net (a GitHub API Client Library for .NET) . This program contains no Models since it's simple enough to use only Controller and Views.



This is built for **Interactive Take Home Assignment**.



Instruction:

This program is built with **Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015**, Before you build the project, 

1. PLEASE open the **MyGithubLists/Controllers/HomeController.cs**;

2. Find **Line 16**;

3. Replace **"You Github Username"** with your own Github username, and **"You Github Password"** with your own Github password:

	```c#
	var basicAuth = new Credentials("You Github Username", "You Github Password"); 
	// NOTE: Replace with your GitHub username and password
	```
	
4. Build and run the project.
